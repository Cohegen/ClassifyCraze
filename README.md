Welcome to the Classification Repository! 
This project showcases the implementation of classification algorithms, a key category of supervised learning used to predict discrete labels or categories.

Features
Classification Algorithms: Implementations of popular models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for handling imbalanced datasets, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC curve analysis.
Visualization: Confusion matrix, decision boundaries, and feature importance plots.
The datasets used in this repositories are the mnist dataset,mnist dataset etc,
